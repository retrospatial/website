  title: Hi! I'm Flo
  text: >
    I am a creative data storyteller and developer. My work primarily lies across data journalism, digital humanities, and interaction design. Currently, I work as an Interactive Engineer at <a href="https://www.citizencodex.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Citizen Codex</a>, a data innovation studio.


    I am interested in using incisive storytelling, visual explorations, and novel data to reveal new truths about how we interact with this world and each other. 


    Previously, I studied Economics and East Asian Studies at Wesleyan and attended the <a href="https://ledeprogram.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Lede Program for Data Journalism</a> at Columbia, where I got my second start in designing and programming graphics for the web. I got my first tinkering with Tumblr themes when I was 14.


    I am originally from Bogor, Indonesia and now based in Cambridge, MA.
